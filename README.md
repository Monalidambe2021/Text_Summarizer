# Text_Summarizer
 NLP
In this project, I will take as input a long text and give as output a crafted summary about this text. Text summarization is one of the most interesting problems in NLP because it is very hard and time-consuming to manually extract the summary of a large document of text. In this project, I could use different traditional and advanced methods to implement automatic text summarization, and then compare the results of each method to conclude which is the best to use for your corpus.
